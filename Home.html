<p>My name is Marcela, I'm 31, and I'm studying to become an elementary school teacher but have always had a strong interest in art and computers. 
I've taken several graphic design and art classes at City College and recently became aware of Mesa College's web design program. 
Although I've always found web development interesting and have always wanted to create my own webpage, I've always found coding a bit intimidating. 
I'm enrolled in various web development and graphic design classes at San Diego City College and Cuyamaca College.<p>
