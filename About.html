    <p>
      I currently work as a classroom aide for the LMSVSD. I also have trouble
      picking something to stick to, which is why I've ended up taking courses
      in many unrelated subjects (library science, graphic design, fine arts,
      teachers education) and changed my major numerous times. I used to see it
      as a weakness, but I've come to make peace with it and use it to my
      advantage. I've used Google Sites to make a website for a class and am
      trying to learn how to use WordPress , but that is the extent of my
      experience in web development. Iâ€™ve taken several graphic design classes
      and have experience making logos, flyers, magazine covers, restaurant
      menus, and album covers.
